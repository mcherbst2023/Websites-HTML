  <h1>My Ethical Dilemma:</h1>
  <h3>You have the ability to hack into the school computer system. You can change people's grades. Would you change your own? Why or why not? What if you could change the grade for a basketbal player who has a scholarship to play for a big university?</h3>

    <h2>What would I do</h2>
    
    <p>Personally, I would not hack the school computer system to change grades.</p>
    
    <h2>Why would I decide to do this?</h2>
    
    <p>I would choose not to change my grades by hacking the school computer system for many reasons. First, I feel like you need to work to get results to be successful in life. If I were to hack into the school system to change my grades, I wouldnt be working for good grades, but I would be cheating for them. Secondly, if I were to hack the school computer system, I would feel too guilty about cheating and it would make me feel more and more terrible over time. Lastly, there is a large risk of me getting easily caught which would force me to serve harsh consequences that would my hurt my ability to get into college, find jobs, and obtain trust from people I am closest to.</p>
