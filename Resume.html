  <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I am currently a Freshman at Medfield High School. I enjoy playing basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. One of my favorite things to do is to play with my 4 year old yellow lab, Chelsey. I have one older brother, one younger, a caring mom, and a cool dad. One thing I deeply care about is my health and wellness. I believe that keeping your body and your mind healthy can easily set you up for success.</p>
  
  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  
  <p>
 Some of my strengths include being a quick learner, I am creative, I am dedicated to the tasks I am given, I am a good team worker, I can easily adapt to changes, I can work independently, I am not easily distracted, I stay calm under high pressure situtions, and I never back down from any challenge.
